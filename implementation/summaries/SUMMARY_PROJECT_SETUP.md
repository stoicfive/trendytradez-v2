# Project Setup - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done
Set up the foundational structure for TrendyTradez v2 with a modern monorepo architecture.

## Directories Created
- `apps/` - Where the main web application will live
- `packages/` - Contains all shared code packages (ui, dashboard, widgets, theme, etc.)
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `.github/workflows/` - Automated testing and deployment workflows
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `implementation/plans/` - Detailed implementation roadmaps
- `implementation/summaries/` - Plain English summaries of work completed

## Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Main project file defining scripts and dependencies
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Tells PNPM how to manage multiple packages
- `turbo.json` - Configures fast builds with intelligent caching
- `tsconfig.base.json` - TypeScript settings for type safety
- `.eslintrc.json` - Code quality rules
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `.nvmrc` - Specifies Node.js version (20.10.0)
- `.gitignore` - Files to exclude from version control

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Track all changes to the project
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete project summary
- `COMMANDS.md` - Reference for all available commands
- `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Detailed vision and goals
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Setup and development guide

### Implementation Plans
Created 8 detailed plans covering the entire development process:
- Project setup (completed)
- Shared packages
- Widget system
- Dashboard core
- Trading tools
- Web application
- Testing and quality assurance
- Deployment

## Key Features Added
- Monorepo structure using Turborepo and PNPM for efficient development
- TypeScript configuration with strict type checking enabled
- Code quality tools (ESLint and Prettier) configured
- Git repository initialized with proper ignore rules
- Complete documentation and implementation roadmap

## Dependencies Installed
- Turborepo - Fast build system with caching
- TypeScript - Type-safe JavaScript
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Node types - TypeScript definitions for Node.js

## What This Means
The project now has a solid foundation to build on. The monorepo structure allows us to organize code into separate packages that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale as the project grows.

## Next Steps
Follow PLAN_01_SHARED_PACKAGES to create the core shared packages (types, utils, UI components, and theme system) that will be used throughout the application.
