# Project Setup - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

Set up the foundational structure for TrendyTradez v2 with a modern monorepo architecture.

## Directories Created

- `apps/` - Where the main web application will live
- `packages/` - Contains all shared code packages (ui, dashboard, widgets, theme, etc.)
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `.github/workflows/` - Automated testing and deployment workflows
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `implementation/plans/` - Detailed implementation roadmaps
- `implementation/summaries/` - Plain English summaries of work completed

## Files Created

### Configuration Files

- `package.json` - Main project file defining scripts and dependencies
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Tells PNPM how to manage multiple packages
- `turbo.json` - Configures fast builds with intelligent caching
- `tsconfig.base.json` - TypeScript settings for type safety
- `.eslintrc.json` - Code quality rules
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `.nvmrc` - Specifies Node.js version (20.10.0)
- `.gitignore` - Files to exclude from version control

### Documentation

- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history tracker
- `COMMANDS.md` - All available commands with descriptions
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete project summary
- `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Detailed vision and goals
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Development setup guide

### Implementation Plans

Created 8 detailed plans covering the entire development roadmap from setup to deployment.

## Key Changes

- Initialized Git repository with first commit
- Installed core dependencies (Turbo, TypeScript, Prettier)
- Configured monorepo workspace structure
- Set up code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Created comprehensive documentation

## Dependencies Installed

- `turbo` - Fast build system with caching
- `typescript` - Type-safe JavaScript
- `prettier` - Code formatter
- `@types/node` - Node.js type definitions

## What This Enables

- Multiple packages can be developed independently
- Fast builds that only rebuild what changed
- Consistent code style across the entire project
- Type safety to catch errors early
- Clear documentation for all team members

## Next Steps

Move to PLAN_01_SHARED_PACKAGES to create the foundational packages that all other code will use.
