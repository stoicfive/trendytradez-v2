# Dashboard Deprecation Plan

## Overview
Deprecate the current basic dashboard UI in favor of a modern, enterprise-grade interface inspired by GitHub's design system.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components
- **App.tsx** - Monolithic component with inline styles (~360 lines)
- **useWebSocket.ts** - WebSocket hook for real-time data
- **No component library** - All UI elements are inline styled divs
- **No design system** - Colors, spacing, typography are hardcoded
- **No reusable components** - Everything is defined in App.tsx

### Current Features
- Real-time WebSocket connection
- Stats cards (packages, test coverage, TODOs, plans, GitHub projects, GitHub issues)
- Package list with status badges
- Recent commits list
- Implementation plans with progress bars
- GitHub integration section

### Technical Debt
- Inline styles make maintenance difficult
- No component reusability
- No theming system
- No responsive breakpoints
- Mixed concerns (data + presentation in one file)
- No component testing infrastructure

---

## Deprecation Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Extraction (Preparation)
**Timeline**: Before new implementation
**Goal**: Extract reusable logic without breaking current UI

1. **Extract Data Hooks**
   - Keep `useWebSocket` as-is
   - Create data transformation hooks
   - Separate business logic from presentation

2. **Document Current Behavior**
   - Screenshot all current views
   - Document all interactive states
   - List all data dependencies

3. **Create Feature Parity Checklist**
   - All current features must be preserved
   - All data flows must remain functional
   - WebSocket connection must work identically

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation
**Timeline**: During new implementation
**Goal**: Build new UI alongside old one

1. **Feature Flag System**
   - Add `USE_NEW_DASHBOARD` environment variable
   - Allow switching between old and new UI
   - Default to old UI until new is complete

2. **Gradual Migration**
   - New UI lives in `dashboard-app/src/components/`
   - Old UI remains in `App.tsx` temporarily
   - Both share same data hooks

3. **Testing Period**
   - Run both UIs in parallel
   - Compare functionality
   - Gather feedback

### Phase 3: Cutover
**Timeline**: After new implementation is verified
**Goal**: Remove old UI completely

1. **Final Verification**
   - All features working in new UI
   - Performance benchmarks met
   - No regressions detected

2. **Remove Old Code**
   - Delete old `App.tsx` implementation
   - Remove inline styles
   - Clean up unused dependencies

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README with new UI screenshots
   - Document new component architecture
   - Update development guide

## Files to Deprecate

### Complete Removal
```
dashboard-app/src/App.tsx (current implementation)
```

### Partial Deprecation
```
dashboard-app/src/main.tsx (update imports only)
```

### Keep As-Is
```
dashboard-app/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts
dashboard-app/package.json
dashboard-app/vite.config.ts
dashboard-app/tsconfig.json
```

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **WebSocket connection disruption** - Mitigation: Keep hook unchanged
- **Data flow breakage** - Mitigation: Maintain same data contracts
- **Performance regression** - Mitigation: Benchmark before/after

### Medium Risk
- **Missing features** - Mitigation: Feature parity checklist
- **Browser compatibility** - Mitigation: Test on multiple browsers
- **Build size increase** - Mitigation: Monitor bundle size

### Low Risk
- **Visual inconsistencies** - Mitigation: Design review process
- **Component naming conflicts** - Mitigation: Clear naming conventions

---

## Rollback Plan

### If New UI Fails
1. Set `USE_NEW_DASHBOARD=false` in environment
2. Revert to old `App.tsx` implementation
3. Fix issues in new UI without pressure
4. Retry cutover when ready

### Backup Strategy
1. Tag current working version before changes
2. Keep old `App.tsx` in `App.legacy.tsx` for 2 sprints
3. Document all breaking changes
4. Maintain changelog

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All current features working in new UI
- [ ] WebSocket connection stable
- [ ] Real-time updates functioning
- [ ] No data loss or corruption
- [ ] All links and navigation working

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Initial load time < 2s
- [ ] Time to interactive < 3s
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations
- [ ] Bundle size < 500KB gzipped

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Zero console errors
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] All components properly typed
- [ ] Code coverage maintained

---

## Timeline

### Week 1: Preparation
- Create implementation plan
- Set up component library structure
- Extract data hooks
- Create feature flag system

### Week 2-3: Implementation
- Build new component library
- Implement new UI
- Test in parallel with old UI

### Week 4: Cutover
- Final testing
- Remove old code
- Update documentation
- Deploy to production

---

## Stakeholder Communication

### Before Deprecation
- Share deprecation plan with team
- Get approval for design changes
- Set expectations for timeline

### During Implementation
- Daily progress updates
- Demo new UI features as completed
- Address concerns immediately

### After Cutover
- Announce successful migration
- Share before/after metrics
- Collect user feedback

---

## Maintenance Notes

### Post-Deprecation
- Monitor error logs for 2 weeks
- Keep old code in git history
- Document lessons learned
- Update team knowledge base

### Long-term
- Establish component library maintenance process
- Set up design system governance
- Plan for future iterations
