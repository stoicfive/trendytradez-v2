## 📋 Implementation Plans Created

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- **PLAN_00**: Project setup with Turborepo + PNPM monorepo
- **PLAN_01**: Shared packages (types, utils, UI, theme, config)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2-4)
- **PLAN_02**: Widget system with drag-and-drop functionality
- **PLAN_03**: Dashboard core with canvas, layout, and state management

### Phase 3: Features (Week 4-5)
- **PLAN_04**: Trading tools (options, stocks, crypto, futures calculators)

### Phase 4: Integration (Week 5-6)
- **PLAN_05**: Web application with routing and authentication

### Phase 5: Quality & Deployment (Week 6-7)
- **PLAN_06**: Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- **PLAN_07**: Production deployment and DevOps

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review Implementation Plans**: Read through all plans in order
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Install Node.js 20 and PNPM 8
3. **Start with PLAN_00**: Begin with project setup
4. **Follow Plans Sequentially**: Each plan builds on the previous

### Development Workflow
1. Read the implementation plan
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions
3. Check off completed tasks
4. Run tests to verify implementation
5. Move to the next plan

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Monorepo?
- Better code organization
- Shared code reuse
- Independent package testing
- Faster CI/CD with incremental builds

### Why Turborepo?
- Intelligent build caching
- Remote cache for teams
- Simple configuration
- Fast performance

### Why PNPM?
- Disk space efficient
- Faster than npm/yarn
- Strict dependency resolution
- Built-in workspace support

### Why 100% TypeScript?
- Type safety prevents bugs
- Better developer experience
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring

## 📝 Notes

### Project Rules
- All project rules from v1 still apply
- See `.windsurf/rules/` in v1 directory
- Follow TT Widget Dashboard Rules
- Maintain code quality standards

### Development Environment
- Each app will have its own dev environment
- v1 remains in `/Users/adamtokola/dev/trendytradez`
- v2 is in `/Users/adamtokola/dev/trendytradez-v2`
- Both can run simultaneously on different ports

### Migration Strategy
- v2 is a fresh start, not a migration
- Learn from v1 mistakes
- Implement best practices from day one
- No legacy code baggage
