## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to update the dashboard after every single commit?**

A: No, only after completing meaningful work (sub-tasks, packages, stories). Small bug fixes or minor changes don't need dashboard updates.

**Q: What if I'm working on multiple tasks simultaneously?**

A: Update "Next Actions" to show all active tasks. Mark multiple sub-tasks as in-progress if needed.

**Q: Can I customize the dashboard?**

A: Yes! It's a single HTML file. Feel free to add sections, change colors, or modify the layout to fit your needs.

**Q: How do I track time spent on tasks?**

A: The dashboard doesn't track time. Use Git commit timestamps or a separate time tracking tool if needed.

**Q: What if I discover a blocker?**

A: Immediately update the "Blockers & Notes" section with details. This keeps the team informed and helps prioritize resolution.
