## What's Different in v2?

### From v1 to v2

#### Architecture
- **v1**: Single-package monolithic app
- **v2**: Modular monorepo with independent packages

#### Type Safety
- **v1**: ~70% TypeScript coverage
- **v2**: 100% TypeScript, strict mode enabled

#### Testing
- **v1**: 0% test coverage
- **v2**: >80% test coverage target

#### Performance
- **v1**: ~500KB bundle, ~3s load time
- **v2**: <300KB bundle, <2s load time

#### Code Quality
- **v1**: Mixed JS/TS, 8 vulnerabilities
- **v2**: Pure TypeScript, zero vulnerabilities

## Core Principles

### 1. Modularity
Every feature is a package. Packages are independent, testable, and reusable.

### 2. Type Safety
100% TypeScript with strict mode. No `any` types in production code.

### 3. Performance
Fast by default. Optimize for initial load, runtime performance, and bundle size.

### 4. Accessibility
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### 5. Testing
Comprehensive test coverage. Unit, integration, and E2E tests for all features.

### 6. Developer Experience
Fast builds, clear documentation, easy onboarding.

## Technology Decisions

### Why Monorepo?
- **Modularity**: Clear package boundaries
- **Reusability**: Share code across apps
- **Testing**: Test packages in isolation
- **Performance**: Only build what changed
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new packages

### Why Turborepo?
- **Fast Builds**: Intelligent caching
- **Remote Cache**: Team collaboration
- **Incremental**: Only rebuild changed packages
- **Simple**: Easy configuration

### Why PNPM?
- **Efficient**: Shared dependencies
- **Fast**: Faster than npm/yarn
- **Strict**: Prevents phantom dependencies
- **Workspace**: Built-in monorepo support

### Why TypeScript?
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **IntelliSense**: Better developer experience
- **Refactoring**: Safe code changes
- **Documentation**: Types as documentation
