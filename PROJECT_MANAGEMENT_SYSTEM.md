# Automated Project Management System

## Overview

Fully automated project management system that synchronizes three environments: **Local Codebase**, **Dashboard**, and **GitHub Projects**. Zero manual updates required.

## System Components

### 1. Local Codebase
- Source code in `packages/` and `apps/`
- Implementation plans in `implementation/plans/`
- Package configurations
- Test files
- Documentation

### 2. Automated Dashboard
- **File Watcher**: Monitors code changes
- **Code Analyzer**: Extracts project data
- **State Manager**: SQLite database
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time updates
- **REST API**: Data access
- **React UI**: Visual dashboard

### 3. GitHub Integration
- **Milestones**: Package tracking
- **Issues**: Task tracking
- **Projects**: Epic/story management
- **Releases**: Version management
- **Webhooks**: Event notifications

## User Flows

### Flow A: Developer Makes Code Changes

```
Developer writes code
    ↓
File watcher detects change (500ms debounce)
    ↓
Analyzer extracts: packages, tests, TODOs, plans
    ↓
State manager updates SQLite database
    ↓
WebSocket broadcasts to dashboard
    ↓
Dashboard UI updates in real-time
    ↓
[Optional] Sync to GitHub
    ↓
GitHub milestones/issues updated
    ↓
Team sees progress on GitHub
```

**Example**: Developer creates new package
1. Create `packages/new-feature/package.json`
2. Dashboard shows new package (pending status)
3. Run `pnpm github:sync`
4. GitHub milestone created automatically
5. Team can track on GitHub Projects

### Flow B: Team Member Updates GitHub

```
Team member closes issue on GitHub
    ↓
GitHub sends webhook POST
    ↓
Webhook server receives event (port 3004)
    ↓
Handler looks up local mapping
    ↓
State manager updates database
    ↓
Dashboard reflects change
    ↓
Developer sees updated status locally
```

**Example**: Team member closes tracking issue
1. Close issue #5 on GitHub
2. Webhook triggers locally
3. Associated plan marked complete
4. Dashboard shows 100% progress
5. Developer notified of completion

### Flow C: Package Completion

```
Developer completes package
    ↓
Tests pass, README added, no TODOs
    ↓
Analyzer marks package as complete
    ↓
Dashboard shows green status
    ↓
Sync to GitHub
    ↓
Milestone closed automatically
    ↓
Related issues closed
    ↓
[Optional] Release created
    ↓
Team notified of release
```

**Example**: Complete @org/ui package
1. Add all tests
2. Remove TODOs
3. Build succeeds
4. Dashboard: "6/7 packages complete"
5. GitHub milestone #5 closed
6. All linked issues closed
7. Release v1.0.0 created

### Flow D: Implementation Plan Tracking

```

    ↓
Tracking issue created
    ↓
Developer checks tasks in plan
    ↓

```

**Example**: PLAN_NEW_FEATURE.md
1. Create plan with 10 tasks
2. Dashboard: "NEW_FEATURE: 0/10 (0%)"
3. GitHub issue #11 created
4. Check off 5 tasks
5. Dashboard: "NEW_FEATURE: 5/10 (50%)"
6. Comment added to GitHub issue
7. Complete all tasks
8. Issue closed automatically

### Flow E: Release Management

```
All packages in milestone complete
    ↓
Analyzer detects completion
    ↓

Create GitHub release
    ↓
Tag repository
    ↓
Attach build artifacts
    ↓
Webhook notifies dashboard
    ↓
Dashboard shows release banner
    ↓
Team receives notification
```

**Example**: v2.0.0 release
1. Last package marked complete
2. System generates release notes
3. GitHub release created with tag v2.0.0
4. Dashboard shows "🎉 v2.0.0 Released"
5. Slack notification sent
6. Team celebrates

## Three-Way Synchronization

### Codebase ←→ Dashboard

**Codebase → Dashboard**:
- File changes trigger analysis
- Package status derived from code
- Test coverage calculated
- TODOs extracted
- Plans parsed

**Dashboard → Codebase**:
- Read-only (dashboard doesn't modify code)
- Displays current state
- Provides insights

### Dashboard ←→ GitHub

**Dashboard → GitHub**:
- Packages → Milestones
- Plans → Tracking issues
- TODOs → Issues
- Status updates sync

**GitHub → Dashboard**:
- Issue closed → Update local state
- Milestone closed → Mark package complete
- Release published → Show notification
- PR merged → Trigger re-analysis

### Codebase ←→ GitHub

**Indirect via Dashboard**:
- Code changes → Dashboard → GitHub
- GitHub events → Dashboard → Developer awareness
- No direct codebase modification from GitHub

## Data Mappings

| Codebase Entity | Dashboard Entity | GitHub Entity |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Package folder | Package record | Milestone |
| PLAN_*.md file | Plan record | Tracking issue |
| TODO comment | TODO record | Issue |
| Commit | Commit record | Linked to issues |
| Test file | Coverage stat | N/A |
| package.json | Package metadata | Milestone description |

## Automation Rules

### Package Status
- **Pending**: Missing tests, README, or has TODOs
- **In Progress**: Has some but not all requirements
- **Complete**: Has dist/, tests, README, no TODOs

### Issue Management
- Auto-create issues from TODOs
- Auto-close issues when package complete
- Auto-update issue labels based on status

### Milestone Management
- Auto-create milestones from packages
- Auto-close milestones when complete
- Link issues to milestones

### Release Management
- Auto-create releases when milestone complete
- Generate release notes from commits
- Tag repository with version

- 10 plans monitored
- 100% sync success rate

### Goals
- Support 50+ packages
- <1 second sync latency
- 99.9% uptime

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not updating
1. Check file watcher is running
2. Verify WebSocket connection
3. Check browser console for errors

### GitHub sync failing
1. Verify token is valid
2. Check rate limits
3. Review sync logs

### Webhook not receiving events
1. Verify webhook URL is public
2. Check webhook secret matches
3. Test with GitHub webhook delivery

**Result**: Seamless three-way synchronization between codebase, dashboard, and GitHub with zero manual intervention.
